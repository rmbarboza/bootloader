# bootloader

This is a step by step bootloader development.

This project started as my curiosity to learn a little bit more how an operating system is loaded.

Facing a problem with a bootloader used at my current job I realised that I knew too few about this topic.
This made me refresh my memory in assembly programming, which I only saw in computer science school, and discover a whole new world about low level computing.

My target was to write a simple Linux based bootloader that reads and boots a Linux image from disk.

After researching and googling I separated each stage so I could explain how I advanced through it.

One could wonder why writing a booloader from scratch if there are other options (including open source) available in internet.

Well, why not? But I can give you 2 good reasons:

1) This is fun.

2) There no better way of learning than doing it yourself.
